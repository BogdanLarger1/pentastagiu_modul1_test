Consider that you have found a defect in the form for the previous exercise. Create a bug report for it.

GIVEN that I'm on the login page
AND I want to login to my account
WHEN I complete the email field with an invalid email - e.g.: it doesn't have the "@yyy.com" after it I only put "Bogdan.larger"
THEN I should be able to access my account

Expected Result: I'm able to see my account page
Actual Result: I'm getting an error message saying that the email is not valid and put the @ after it.
