In the images folder you have a login form. Create Test Cases for the given form.

Please state the testing types(functional, non-functional, black box, white box, design technique) for each TC created.
 

TC1 - functional
1. Click on the "Sign In" button in the left hand side of the page
2. Make sure that the button was clicked
3. Make sure that the section where the button is gets on the right hand side of the page
4. On the new page that appears you'll have the email/pwd fields if you have an existing account where you can sign in
5. If you don't have an account, in the right side you'll have the sign up button where you can create a new account.

TC2 - non-functional - performance
1. Try to log-in with more than 5 accounts at the same time
2. Try to put more than 1 email in the field separated by ","

TC3 - black box TC
As I mentioned in the white box/black box txt:
1. Press on the Sign in button
2. When the account/pwd are appearing just have an image copied to clipboard and just ctrl+v the image in one of the fields and see if there's an error popping

TC4 - white box
1. You already know what you should complete in all fields
2. Make sure that if you complete the fields correctly 
2.1. You'll see for e.g. from API a success message - 200
3. If you don't put for e.g. to an email field where "@" is required you'll get an error message - 400

TC5 - Design technique
1. Make sure that the design it's the same as the UI/UX 
2. Make sure that everything corresponds from the design on the front end
3. The colours are the same, the font and font size are the same
4. Make sure that the distances are the same, placeholders of the fields are there
5. Make sure that the transition corresponds - it's not going to left
