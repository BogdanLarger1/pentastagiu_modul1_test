Please state what is black box testing? How about white box testing? You can also give an example.


Black box testing is when the tester isn't aware of the code/design of what was implemented, test are functional for black box testing.

White box is when the tester knows exactly what have been added in code (what feature) and  he doesn't need to search for it, he can see even the code.

Let's take an example of a search field on a web-page
White box testing knows exactly what's behind that field(what you can search for - letters/numbers/special characters) as for a black box you may try to copy-paste an image in the search field, or any other combinations that won't work.
